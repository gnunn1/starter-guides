You will be interacting with an OpenShift environment that is running on a
public cloud. The environment consists of the following systems:

* {{ ENV_MASTERS }} master node(s)
* {{ ENV_INFRA }} infrastructure node(s)
* {{ ENV_NODES }} "application" nodes
* An NFS server

The infrastructure node is providing several services:

* Gogs git server
* This lab manual
* The OpenShift Docker registry
* The OpenShift router
* Etherpad

Additionally, a predefined number of user accounts have been provisioned. Your
username will be "userX" where "X" is replaced by a number assigned to you
by the instructor.

For example, if assigned number 8, your username will be "user8". If assigned
number 22, your username will be "user22".

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises.
Some of the command blocks can be copy/pasted directly. Others will require
modification of the command before execution. If you see a command block with
a red border (see below), the command will require modification. Typically
this is a substitution of your username or user number:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
some command for {{ USER_NAME }}
----
